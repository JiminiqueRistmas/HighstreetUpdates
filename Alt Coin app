Alt Coin app

It would be pretty cool to have a way to track my own investments in the alt coin community. It's interesting to see that some people create these dashboards / apps, and include a login page; sure one side says that it's a service, that the programmer is interested in, and want's to share his experience, but it seems to me that a well adopted web app could also provide valuable market insight. The owners of such apps could have, on their hands, the most robust predicitive information available. They essentially have the inside look into the thoughts, concerns, and possible next steps. It's a winner form multiple angles.
