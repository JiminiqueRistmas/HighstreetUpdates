What does this do?

Okay so I just added this to my repository. I'm going to make a few changes and then see if there are any congergence issues...

Okay so that last push worked, I'm going to add this text and run a git pull command (without saving the doc) I just ran the pull and status without saving... nothing. I'm going to save it now, and see what happens. 

Pull shows no updates have been made, but the status shows that there are changes that need to be committed.

Now I'm adding a few things from the github online gui, I'll save them and see if there are any pull errors detected.
